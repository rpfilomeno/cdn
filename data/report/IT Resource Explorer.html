    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A dashboard-style SPA featuring a primary interactive filtering/search section and a dynamic grid of resource cards. This structure was chosen to transform the static, linear report into a user-centric tool. It allows users to quickly find relevant resources based on their needs (e.g., by topic or keyword) rather than scrolling through a long, undifferentiated list. A modal is used for detailed analysis to maintain a clean primary interface, following the principle of progressive disclosure. This non-linear, interactive approach is far more usable and efficient for the target audience of IT professionals. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info -> Goal -> Viz/Presentation Method -> Interaction -> Justification -> Library/Method.
        1. List of URLs/Descriptions/Tags -> Organize/Inform -> Interactive Card Grid -> JS-powered filtering by search and tag clicks -> A dynamic grid is more scannable and user-friendly than a static table. -> HTML/Tailwind/JS.
        2. Detailed Analysis Text -> Inform (on-demand) -> Modal Window -> Triggered by a button on each card -> Hides lengthy text by default to avoid clutter, providing deep-dives only when requested. -> HTML/Tailwind/JS.
        3. Resource Tags -> Filter/Organize -> Clickable Buttons/Badges -> Clicking a tag filters the main grid -> Provides a quick, intuitive way to explore resources by category. -> HTML/Tailwind/JS.
        4. Key Observations -> Inform/Synthesize -> Static styled cards in a dedicated section -> No interaction needed, presents high-level takeaways clearly -> This content provides valuable context and is presented as a distinct summary. -> HTML/Tailwind.
